# FirstPHP
First attempt at using PHP

index.php is used for navigation between files

part2.php outputs a string in a triangle form( increments of letter, until all string is displayed, then decrements by one letter)

part3.php function and loop that checks wether the first monday after our National holiday was/ will be a weekend.

part4_input.php form to get intervals for the function in part3.php

part4_result.php validates part4_input.php and dispalays corresponding outputs.
